//! `llmtrim wrap <agent> [-- <args>]` — thin convenience launcher.
//!
//! This is *sugar*, not a provider system. It does two things:
//!
//!   1. Confirm the interceptor is wired (the same `HTTPS_PROXY` mechanism `setup`
//!      installs and `start` checks), so the agent's HTTPS to LLM hosts routes through
//!      llmtrim — there is **no** per-agent quirk handling, no base-URL writing, no
//!      allow-list of "supported" agents. Any binary on PATH works, and on Windows a
//!      `.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1` shim is launched the way the shell would launch it (see
//!      `resolve_launch_for_platform`).
//!   2. Exec the named binary as a subprocess that inherits the current environment
//!      (which, post-`setup` + a fresh shell, already carries `HTTPS_PROXY` and the CA
//!      trust vars), forwarding the passthrough args and propagating its exit code.
//!
//! Setup-check behaviour (deliberate, least-surprising): if the env isn't wired we do
//! **not** silently mutate the user's shell profile or env — that's `setup`'s job and
//! doing it from a launcher would be a surprising side effect. We print a clear pointer
//! to `llmtrim setup` and refuse, so the user never gets a wrapped agent that quietly
//! bypasses compression. We *do* start a stopped daemon only when the env is already
//! wired (trivially safe: the contract — port + CA — is already in place, same as `start`).
